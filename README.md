## About the Video Course
RESTful Web Services is a stateless client-server architecture where web services are resources and can be identified by their URIs. Implementing RESTful Web Services with Java helps to simplify the development and deployment of web services. This course will show you how to implement a REST Web Service (API) in Java from scratch (using servlets), covering the basic concepts. This will be later followed by improvements in security, authentication, authorization, scalability, performance, API modeling, CORS, versioning, and documentation. Finally, you will find out what libraries are available to help you implement an API with ease, how to integrate with different layers and kinds of dependencies, how to integrate with other APIs, and where and how to deploy your application. By the end of this course, you will be able to efficiently create reliable and powerful Java RESTful Web Services and get a clear understanding of the process by implementing it your web apps.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This video targets Java Developers who want to create powerful and reliable Java RESTful Web Services. Knowledge of the basics of Java programming is assumed; however, no previous experience in creating RESTful web services is required.
### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
Hardware Requirements

•	You are a Java Developer, so you certainly have a machine powerful enough to run Java, Maven, and your IDE of choice.
•	We won't use much more hardware than you probably already have. 

Software Requirements

•	OS: Linux (or other)
•	Java 11+
•	Maven 3.6.0+
•	IDE of your choosing (I'll be using IntelliJ IDEA and VSCode, but you can use vim or whatever you like!)
•	Postman (any version, we are going to use A LOT to test the APIs)
•	Database setup (for some later videos we will connect to a local databse running on your machine, I'll use Postgres, just install and create an empty database)
